This is a simple program which helps you in your day-to-day life.

I was attending online classes for a long time and at times had trouble always being on time.

As I wanted to be exactly on time, and also knew that machines are more precise and smart than humans. decided to write this program.

Just paste the link you would like to open first, and the time you want it opened.

This way you wonâ€™t be even 1 second late ever :) without even trying.
